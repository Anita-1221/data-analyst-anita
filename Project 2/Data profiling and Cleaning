Data Quality Control for Academic User Logs â€“ UCW Project
Project Title: Implementation of Data Quality Control Measures for Academic Logs at UCW
Objective:
To establish a robust data quality control framework for managing academic user log data stored in Amazon S3. The focus is on ensuring accuracy, completeness, consistency, and long-term integrity through profiling, cleaning, validation, and lifecycle rules using AWS Glue DataBrew and S3.

Background:
Academic systems at University Canada West collect detailed logs and records, which were previously unmanaged. This project implements a scalable solution to ingest, profile, clean, and monitor these logs in AWS, ensuring regulatory compliance and data readiness for analytics.

Dataset:

academics-user-log.txt: A structured log file with 50 rows and multiple attributes.
Additional datasets: Academic sanction, Student Lists, and Case Lists.
Methodology:

Current State Assessment
Analyzed user logs and academic data in AWS S3.
Identified data issues: inconsistent column structures and lack of validation checks.
Data Profiling (using AWS Glue DataBrew)
Identified column types, missing values, and duplicate rows.
Profiled datasets:
aca-sanction-list-ds-anita
Aca-Case-list-ds-anita
Aca-student-list-ds-anita
